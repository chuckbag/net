# Variables

## Define variable type

### Strings: 
you can define a variable to be just a string. 
Code:
``` 
greetings = "hello world"
print("string output = " + str(greetings))
```
Output: 
```
string output = hello world
```

### Integers and Floats: 
Integers are normal numbers, floats include a decimal point.  

Code:
```
n = 9
print("integer = ", int(n))   # print type of variable "number"

float_number = 9
print("float number = ",float(float_number))
```
Output: 
```
integer =  9
float number =  9.0
```
