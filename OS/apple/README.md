- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](apps/MS-Code.md):


## Apps to Note: 
- [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle): very good drawing app.   Definitely better then the new versions of Visio.  
- [Serial](https://www.decisivetactics.com/products/serial/): A ~really~ great serial terminal for the mac.  (yea, you don't need it, but it's worth it.)
- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/): it's like MobiaXterm but for mac and it's better
- [KyPass Companion](http://www.kyuran.be/software/kypass4mac/): An encrypted repo for passwords
- [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/): Keyboard Customizer! (remap keys on your gaming keyboard)
- [MacVIM](https://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/).  What else would you use for a text editor (!?!?!?)
visual code Studio from Microsoft.  Ok, that's maybe a better text editor.... (plus you can add VI controls!)
- [Xee3](https://xee.c3.cx/): An image viewer that will browse all images in a folder.  
- [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html): Screen capture and image markup tool
- [New File Menu](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/new-file-menu/id1064959555?mt=12): allows you to right-click add test files in directories (simple but needed)
- [XQuartz](http://net.cmed.us/Home/apple/apps/xquartz): Xterm for Mac
- [QCAD](../../App/qcad/basic-overview.md): 2D CAD software for linux
- [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com/download/) and [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) for ripping DVD's
- [p4merge](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core-apps/merge-diff-tool-p4merge) is the best diffing app out there
- [iStat Menu](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/istat-menus/id1319778037?mt=12) is arguably a waste of money, but I really like using it to see the stats of my mac
- For better or worse, [AirMail](http://net.cmed.us/Home/apple/apps#:~:text=better%20or%20worse%2C-,AirMail,-and%20Fantastical%20are) and [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) are fairly good mail and calendar apps (airmail is affordable, but needs some more features, and Fantastical is great but overpriced).
- [SimpleMind](https://simplemind.eu/): A good mind map program
- [NTFS for Mac](https://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-mac/): if you want to mount ntfs volumes and write to them (usb drives) you need this.  
- [Wifi Explorer](https://www.adriangranados.com/): free wifi scanner
- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/): (sigh) .. yea.. The IDE is actually really good....
