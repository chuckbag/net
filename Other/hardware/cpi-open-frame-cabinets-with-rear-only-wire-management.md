# CPI Open Frame Cabinets with Rear only wire management

## Overview

The CPI open frame rack solution includes very tall (51u) cabinets, and very complete wire management control between the cabinets (10"-12"). The examples spec'ed out below come in two flavors, one that only needs wire management on one side of the racks (for normal servers with wiring only in the rear), and with racks with wire management in the front and rear. The examples also include 4 racks ganged together, rather then one cabinet by itself.
The measurements for a system with both front and rear cable management is shown in the diagram below.

## Rear-only Wire Management

This has 10" wire managers on the ends, and 12" wire managers in between the cabinets as well, and wire managers on one side, and blanking panels on the other to provide a flush plane between the racks.

## PDU Mounts
The PDUs snap into brackets we hang from the sides of the racks, in between the cabinets.

|manufacturer	|part number|	description	Unit|	Unit Price|
|--|--|--|--|
CHATSWORTH|	TS1024517	|EVOLUTION DS VERT MANAGER RETRO DUAL PDU KIT	|EA	 $       155.00
CHATSWORTH	 |	|top and bottom mounting brackets|	 	 |

The brackets we have will hold two, not four PDU's, but they look just like the following red PDU trays.

Rather than mounting on the back of the wire managers, we use the following two blue mounting brackets to mount the PDU trays to the sides of the cabinets, so that adding additional PDUs is easier. Note that you need at least 12" wide wire managers to be able to have PDUs' facing each other and still have wiring room.
