## Overview: 
The following are examples showing how to do basic activities within the QCAD user interface. 

## Lines
All different ways to place a line on the page

### Simple Horizontal or Vertical lines
When you just want to place your first lines on the page. 

| Select the Line tool (1) | Then select either the Horizontal (2) or vertical (3) line tool | 
|--|--|

### Parallel - Set Distance
When you already have a line, and you want to make another one parallel to it but some distance away from it.

| Select the Line tool (1) | Then select the Line Parallel (2) option, and then enter in the distance away (3) you want the parallel line.  (for 2.5 inches, enter 2.5") | Then select a line in the drawing (4), and move the mouse to one of the sides of the line.  It will then place the next line the set distance away (5). |

### Trim line to another line
Two tricks for either shortening a line where it intersects with another line, or to extend a line to the point where it intersects with another line. 

For both options, first

| Select the Modification Tool (1) | Then select the Trim Tool (2) | 
|--|--|
| <img src="img/2020-04-13_21-07-24b.png" alt="select mod tool"> | <img src="img/2020-04-13_21-25-23.png" alt="select trim tool"> |

We want to extend one line (a) down to another (b), and then we want to remove all the excess (c) part of (b).

#### Extend line to another line
When one line does not go far enough, and you want to extend it until it touches another line.  

| To first extend the line, select the line we don't want to change (3) | and then select the line you want modified (4). | 
|--|--|
| <img src="img/2020-04-13_21-34-24.png" alt="select line to terminate to"> | <img src="img/2020-04-13_21-34-35.png" alt="select line to extend"> |

Notice how the line we clicked second is extended to the line we clicked first?  

#### Trim line to another line
Now to remove the excess line (which is a trim)

| select the line we don't want to change (5) | and then select the side of the line that we want to keep (6), and the rest of the line will be deleted. |
|--|--|
| <img src="img/2020-04-13_21-39-33.png" alt="select endpoint line"> | <img src="img/2020-04-13_21-40-34.png" alt="select line to shorten"> |

Here's a bunch more trimming examples.  First click the line you don't want to modify (1), and then the one you do (2).

### Extend line to a distance
When you have two intersecting lines, and you want to have one (or both) of the lines to stop at the point of intersection.

Select the Modification Tool <img src="img/2021-02-12_10-56-35.png" alt=""> icon, and then the Lengthen/Shorten <img src="img/2021-02-12_10-56-45.png" alt=""> icon.  

Then in the field titled "Amount" in the top of the page, enter the length to modify the line to.  

<img src="img/2021-02-12_11-02-17.png" alt="enter length amount"> 

Then every line you select will be lengthen/shortened to that distance.
