Create your second level header, but apply the "h1" setting to it. 

Then increase the indent to it.  This will create "1.1" numbering scheme.

To remove the indent, right click on the selected text, and select the "paragraph.." option.

You can also make other formatting changes, like change the font size, color, etc.

Then save the changes as the new "Heading 2" by right clicking on the text, selecting Styles, then right clicking on Heading 2, and selecting "update heading 2 to match selection".
