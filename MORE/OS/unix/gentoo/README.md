System Notes:
- [Basic HOWTo's](gentoo-howtos.md): some simple notes on running Gentoo.  


Systems build for specific purposes:
- [Filer](gentoo-p1-nas.md).  A basic NAS server.  Has two data disks, and an os disk.  Runs samba and nfs and nothing else.
- [Filer2](gentoo-filer2.md). A bit more advanced NAS server.
