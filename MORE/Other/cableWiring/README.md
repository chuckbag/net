# Cabling
 

## Overview:

Serial connections, or console connections are (most basically) a way to link devices together. In these pages we are interested in serial connections because a lot of network equipment and computers allow access and control of devices through serial connections.  For example, before the network settings are configured on a Cisco router, you access it and configure it though it's console connection. You link your PC to this through the PC's serial (modem) connection. These pages address how those devices communicate with each other, and the wiring needed to connect them.
