### Tunneling:
- [Standard SSL Tunnel](ssl-tunnel.md): how to tunnel traffic through a standard ssl connection.

### Encryption:
- [GPG](gpg.md): "GNU Privacy Guard" (aka: PGP "pretty good privacy") how to install and use. 
- [IPSec](ipsec.md): Theory behind the VPNs
- [ssl certs](sslCerts.md): how to setup and use

### Tools:

### My Notes: 
- [NMAP](../OS/unix/nmap.md): Standard, everyday must-have tool  (pen testing/etc)
- [ZMAP](../OS/unix/zmap.md): Same as Nmap, but way-way faster!
