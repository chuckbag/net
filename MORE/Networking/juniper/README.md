Juniper has had a couple of platforms in their day.  Here's some notes on the different technologies. 

- [Netscreen](Netscreen.md): The original juniper firewall.  
- [Pulse](pulse/README.md): SSLVPN Concentrator.  (yea, is should be it's own company, but Im keepting it in here)
- [JunOS](junos.md): All things juniper.  
- [JTAC](ftp-to-tac.md): When you need help
