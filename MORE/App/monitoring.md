# Monitoring / Internet Based Tools

## Logging 
- [syslog](../OS/unix/syslog.md): local and remote logging
- [syslog-ng](../OS/unix/syslog-ng.md): How to setup a syslog service
- [Splunk](splunk/README.md): BI tool for log data. 

## Polling: 
- [SNMP](snmp.md): How to "simply" monitor other systems.

## Free Monitoring Solutions:
- [Cacti](cacti/README.md): Good SNMP Poller and grapher.  ("nexgen-MRTG")
- [Ganglia Monitoring System](http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/): Great for collecting enormous data within massive sets of data centers.  Does not do alarming.
- [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/): Simple standard for host based monitoring and alerting.
- [Zabbix](http://www.zabbix.com/): Next step up from Cacti.
- [OpenTSDB](http://opentsdb.net/): Very scalable monitoring platform.  Sounds like Ganglia-ish.
- [RANSID](http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/): simple config collector. 
- [SmokePing](smokeping.md): a nice pinging tool that graphs and uses rrdb

## Free Internet Tools to use:
- [Robtex DNS](http://www.robtex.com/dns/): Track down all DNS info related to a site (part of the "Swiss Army Knife Internet Tool")
- [Robtex](http://www.robtex.com/as/) AS: View the BGP peering of an AS (part of the "Swiss Army Knife Internet Tool")
- [BGPlay](http://bgplay.routeviews.org/): shows animated graphs of routing activity of specific prefixes
- [IPCalc](http://jodies.de/ipcalc): IP Calculator that is great
- [HostIP.info](http://hostip.info/): What is your IP address.  (only with out all the mess and spam)

## Expensive Solutions to Note:
- [appneta](http://www.appneta.com/): icmp based hosted monitoring solution.  Does not compare to the above, but provides interesting QoS metrics.
- [ThousandEyes](https://www.thousandeyes.com/):
