- [Structuring Data](structuring-data.md): How to use some basic commands to manipulate data

- [Basic Data Visualization](basic-data-visualization.md): How to take manipulated data and visualize it with graphs and charts.  
- [Extract New Fields](extract-new-fields.md): how to specify special data in the logs that should be indexed
- [Take indexed data and graph it](take-indexed-data-and-graph-it.md): If you've extracted the fields and searched for data that contains it, then you can do nice reports with it.
